        "Adam maintains a decaying average of past gradients, known as the first moment (the mean), which serves as a velocity component. This allows Adam to continue moving in the direction of persistent reduction in the objective function, even if the current gradient is small, helping to navigate the parameter space more efficiently.\n",

        "\n",
        "Adam adapts the learning rates of parameters based on the second moment $v_t$ (the uncentered variance) of the gradients. This means that parameters with large gradients will have smaller updates to prevent overshooting, and parameters with small gradients will have larger updates to accelerate the learning process. This adaptive mechanism is particularly useful for dealing with sparse data and features.\n",

        "The defining characteristic of AdaGrad is its approach to learning rates: it assigns each parameter its own learning rate which is modified according to the historical aggregated gradient information of that parameter. This is done by accumulating the square of each gradient component, creating a historical sum which then informs the adjustment of the learning rate. When parameters are updated, AdaGrad scales down the learning rate by the square root of this accumulated sum, offset slightly by a small smoothing term to avoid division by zero.\n",

        "One of the most significant advantages of AdaGrad is that it removes the need to manually fine-tune the learning rate, a common challenge in many machine learning applications. It naturally adapts to the data, providing a more nuanced approach to learning rate modification, particularly for problems with sparse features where the frequency of feature updates can vary dramatically.\n",
        "\n",

In such a landscape there are numerous dips and valleys with varying dimensions, contours, and gradients.

However, as we delve deeper into the descent, the valleys become narrower (akin to enhancing the resolution or magnifying the view), and a large learning rate could cause us to overshoot. Gradually reducing the learning rate results in more measured steps that guide the trajectory squarely into the valley's depths. Moreover, if done correctly it will give us faster convergence than having a perpetually miniscule learning rate.\n",

        "1) Eigendecomposition allows us to leverage the system's preferred directions, meaning we operate within a coordinate framework where the coordinates $w^1, \\ldots, w^k$ align with our objective function's directions. In the original coordinate system, a gradient descent step may intertwine several coordinates, but in the transformed system, these coordinates become independent of one another. This independence enables us to examine the gradient descent process in each direction individually, with $\\lambda_i$ indicating the rate of convergence in each newly defined direction.\n",
        "\n",
        "2) The issue with this gradient descent approach becomes evident when the condition number, $\\lambda_n / \\lambda_i$, is large. This discrepancy suggests that convergence occurs rapidly in certain directions and slowly in others. The learning rate, given by $\\frac{\\lambda_n / \\lambda_i - 1}{\\lambda_n / \\lambda_i + 1}$, is applied uniformly across all directions, as illustrated by:\n",

Consequently, if $\\lambda$ is large in one direction and the learning rate is also high, it's likely we'll surpass the optimal point in that direction. Conversely, if $\\lambda$ is small in a certain direction and the learning rate is correspondingly low, convergence may not be achieved.\n",
        "Therefore, the central problem lies in the uniform application of the learning rate across all directions, despite varying rates of convergence among them.\n",
        "\n",
        "3) In the lecture notes, the update mechanism for momentum is characterized by the equation $\\boldsymbol{w}_{k+1} \\propto R^{k+1}$. This equation signifies that understanding the characteristics of the matrix $R$ can inform us about the potential for convergence in the iterative process. Specifically, if the norm $\\Vert R^k \\Vert$ stays within limits for all $k$, this indicates that the sequence $\\boldsymbol{w}_k$ is unlikely to diverge. The analysis further clarifies that the norm of $R$ is restricted by $\\max{i} |e_i|^k$, with $e_i$ being the eigenvalues of $R$. Consequently, if the maximum absolute eigenvalue, $\\max |e_i|$, is less than 1, it implies that this upper limit will diminish to zero as $k$ approaches infinity, signaling convergence.\n",
        "Crucially, $R$ incorporates two modifiable hyperparameters: the learning rate $\\alpha$ and the momentum rate $\\beta$. Adjusting these parameters allows us to ensure that $\\max |e_i| < 1$. This flexibility is key for steering the iterative updates towards convergence by fine-tuning the conditions under which the momentum mechanism functions.\n",

        "4) In the analysis presented in the lecture notes, when the discriminant is negative, we encounter a pair of complex conjugate eigenvalues, $\\lambda_1$ and $\\lambda_2$, where $\\lambda_1 = \\lambda_2^*$. Our goal, as outlined in section (3), is to ensure that $\\max |\\lambda_i|$ is less than 1. Under these conditions, we determine that:\n",

This influence is exerted independently of other hyperparameters, such as $\\alpha$, allowing for their independent optimization. This independence is crucial for fine-tuning the convergence behavior of our system without the interdependencies that typically complicate hyperparameter adjustment.\n"

        "\n",
        "In the left graph, the training loss for all models is observed to be decreasing, indicating that each model is converging. However, the convergence rate varies among the models; notably, the neural network with a depth of 1 converges more rapidly than that with a depth of 10.\n",
        "\n",
        "On the right graph, in a similar vein, the test loss for all three neural networks diminishes as the number of epochs increases, with some variance and potentially overfitting after 10 epochs as the test loss begins to increase. Yet, the neural network with a depth of 1 exhibits a lower test loss compared to those with depths of 5 and 10, suggesting it is the most effective model among those tested. It might be hypothesized that the neural network with a depth of 10 overfits the training data due to overparameterization, which would account for its higher test loss compared to the model with a depth of 1. However, this hypothesis does not hold in this instance, as the training loss for the neural network with a depth of 10 is actually higher than that for the neural network with a depth of 1, suggesting that its primary challenge is achieving optimal convergence in a more complex loss landscape.\n",
        "\n",
        "Upon fine-tuning the parameters to enable convergence across various network depths, intriguing findings emerge. The plots reveal that training becomes increasingly challenging with network depth; deeper networks exhibit slower convergence rates, necessitating more epochs to achieve convergence. This observation aligns with theoretical expectations, as deeper models navigate more complex loss landscapes, making optimization more difficult. Deep neural networks are more susceptible to getting trapped in local minima and may encounter issues with vanishing or exploding gradients, leading to slow or erratic training. In contrast, shallower networks, with fewer layers and parameters, tend to be simpler to train.\n",
        "\n",
        "Additionally, the test loss plot indicates that deeper neural networks incur higher test losses. This can be attributed to the increased capacity of deeper networks to overfit the training data, as their larger number of parameters allows them to more precisely model the training set but also makes them more prone to adapting to noise. Conversely, shallower networks, with their reduced parameter count, are less likely to overfit. However, the observed discrepancy in test losses might also reflect the deeper networks' struggle with optimal convergence due to the intricate loss landscape. It's conceivable that extending the training duration for the deeper network could potentially lower its test loss relative to the neural network with a depth of 1."

        "Upon analysing the training and testing errors through graphical representation, we observe a pattern that aligns closely with our expectations set forth in the assignment, particularly when adhering to the specified window size. Notably, there's a discernible decrease in training loss as network width—or the number of neurons within each hidden layer—expands. This trend underscores the principle that a neural network's complexity, and consequently its ability to model the training data, escalates with increased neuronal count. Consistent with the assignment's guidance, the testing error mirrors this behavior, diminishing as network width grows.\n",
        "\n",
        "The compiled data from training various neural network configurations reveals a clear correlation between network width and error rates: both training and testing errors recede as the width broadens. This phenomenon aligns with insights from recent research, which suggests that testing error either continues to decrease or remains stable, even as the network's parameter count significantly escalates. Contrary to traditional generalisation bounds—which would predict an uptick in testing error due to overfitting at a certain parameter threshold—our observations corroborate the continuous improvement in error rates with increasing width. Our findings, mirroring those anticipated in the exercise guidelines, indicate a successful replication of the expected outcome.\n",
        "\n",
        "Furthermore, the lectures highlight that increased network width tends to enhance the convexity of the optimisation landscape, thereby facilitating a more effective fit to the data. It is therefore logical and anticipated that both training and testing errors would decline as network width is augmented. Our analysis suggests that we have identified a set of configuration parameters where both test error and loss diminish in tandem with an increase in network parameters.\n",
        "\n",
        "However, it's worth noting that an optimal network width seems to be around 64 neurons per hidden layer, marked by a significant reduction in both testing error and loss. Beyond this point, the risk of overfitting becomes pronounced due to potential over-parameterisation, cautioning against excessively expanding the network width.\n"

Each vector term on the right-hand side, given the inputs $x $ and $x' $, is independent and identically distributed. It is assumed that the variances of the activities are bounded. The chosen scaling for the variances aligns perfectly with the conditions required for the central limit theorem to hold and is consistent with the initialization strategies most commonly employed in practice. Consequently, as the number of units $ H $ increases, $ F^{(2)} $ tends toward a multivariate normal distribution in terms of distribution.

        "We define a class `GP` to encapsulate a Gaussian Process model, leveraging a provided kernel function to model and predict outcomes based on observations.\n",
        "\n",
        "The `predict` method of the `GP` class takes in new test points `x_star`, along with observed data points `X` and their corresponding responses `y`. It also allows specifying the number of posterior samples to draw (`size`) and the noise level (`sigma`) in the observations. The core functionality of this method is to fit the GP model to the observations and to predict the outcomes at the test points by drawing samples from the posterior distribution defined by the fitted model.\n",
        "\n",
        "The method starts by computing several kernel matrices: `k_xs_x` (covariance between test points and observed points), `k_x_xs` (transpose of `k_xs_x`), `k_xs_xs` (covariance between test points), and `k_x_x` (covariance between observed points). It then adds noise variance to the diagonal of `k_x_x` to form the observed covariance matrix `cov_x_x`, accounting for observation noise.\n",
        "\n",
        "Using these matrices, the method calculates the posterior mean and variance of the predictions at the test points. The posterior mean provides the best guess of the function values at `x_star`, while the posterior variance captures the uncertainty around these predictions.\n",
        "\n",
        "To ensure numerical stability and the mathematical properties of covariance matrices, the method enforces symmetry and positive definiteness on the computed posterior variance. This is done by averaging the matrix with its transpose and adding a small noise term to the diagonal elements.\n",
        "\n",
        "Finally, the method draws samples from a multivariate normal distribution defined by the posterior mean and variance, providing a probabilistic forecast for the test points. The posterior variance is then adjusted to remove the diagonal variance so that later, when we compute the `argmax`, the result is the largest covariance, rather than the largest variance."

        "The above graph depicts the relationship between the depth of the neural network-like structure (denoted as \\( L \\)) and the accuracy of a Gaussian Process (GP) model with a ReLU kernel. Three lines represent the maximum, average, and minimum accuracy achieved for each depth level ranging from 1 to 10.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Maximum Accuracy (Blue Line)**: This line remains relatively constant across different depths, indicating that the best-case performance of the model does not significantly improve or degrade as the depth increases. The model's best performance is achieved at low depth and is maintained as  $L$ increases.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Average Accuracy (Orange Line)**: The average accuracy appears to decrease as the depth increases. Initially, the decrease is gradual, but after $ L = 4 $, the rate of decrease becomes more pronounced. This suggests that on average, increasing the depth of the network structure beyond a certain point may lead to a reduction in performance, possibly due to overfitting or increased model complexity.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Minimum Accuracy (Green Line)**: The minimum accuracy shows a sharp drop after $ L = 2 $, reaching the lowest point at $ L = 3 $ and remaining constant thereafter. This indicates that there are some configurations of the GP model (i.e combinations of $ \\sigma_b $ and $ \\sigma_w $) that result in poor performance, particularly at greater depths. This might reflect instances where the model is highly sensitive to the choice of hyperparameters or where certain configurations are not suitable for deeper structures. Specifically, when the accuracy is 0, it means that the GP has failed due to numerical issues. This seems toonly occur for $L\\geq 6$\n",
        "\n",
        "While the optimal performance of the GP model does not vary with depth, the average and worst-case performances tend to decrease. This could imply that the benefits of increasing depth in this context are limited and that there is a potential for decreased robustness or increased variability in model performance at higher depths. It also highlights the importance of careful hyperparameter selection, especially as the depth of the model increases."

        "The above graph represents the relationship between the variance of the weights $ \\sigma_w^2$ , on a logarithmic scale, and the accuracy of the GP. Again we plot three lines, each representing the maximum, average, and minimum accuracy achieved for varying levels of $ \\sigma_w^2 $.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Maximum Accuracy (Blue Line)**: This line trends upward initially as $\\sigma_w^2 $ increases, reaching a plateau before slightly declining. This suggests that up to a certain point, increasing the weight variance improves the model's performance, possibly by allowing greater flexibility. However, beyond a certain level of $ \\sigma_w^2 $, the accuracy either saturates or begins to diminish, possibly due to overfitting or instability in the model predictions due to the excess posterior covariance. We would expect higher $\\sigma_w$ in the prior to yield higher variance in the posterior predictions due to the nature of the kernel.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Average Accuracy (Orange Line)**: The average accuracy shows a steady increase with the increase in $ \\sigma_w^2 $ up to a certain peak, after which it declines. The peak indicates an optimal range of $ \\sigma_w^2 $ values that, on average, yield the best model performance. Beyond this optimal point, too much variance might be detrimental, reflecting a trade-off between model flexibility and overfitting.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Minimum Accuracy (Green Line)**: The minimum accuracy sharply increases with the initial increase in $ \\sigma_w^2 $, which implies that higher weight variance is necessary to avoid the worst-case scenarios of model performance. However, similar to the average accuracy, it peaks and then shows a significant drop, suggesting that extremely high variance in the weights can lead to poor model performance in some cases.\n",
        "\n",
        "In addition, it seems that the model only fails due to non-positive semidefiniteness of the covariance matrix when $\\sigma_2^2=0.01$. This may be due to near-deterministic outputs. If we were to rerun, perhaps we would exclude this case."

        "Above we can see that smaller values of $L$ work better with $\\sigma_w^2=1$, and larger values prefer $\\sigma_w^2=2$. This is some indication that higher weight variance works better with more layers. On the whole, it seems that increasing the weight variance yields more accurate predictions. This allows the model to adapt to more variance in the images. However, this will likely increase the posterior variance, and thus uncertainty of the predictions. Tuning $\\sigma_w^2$ can be likened to the bias-variance tradeoff in tuning a regular neural network."
